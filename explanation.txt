Out of the three, bubble sort took the longest coming in at around 51 seconds to complete.
The second longest was selection sort which took about 47 seconds to complete. The fastest
sort by far was quick sort which took about 1-2 seconds to complete. I believe that bubble
sort took the longest to complete because it had millions of calls to different parts of the
program such as std::vector which had over one billion calls to it. I believe it is much less
efficient than quick sort.
